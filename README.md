# BE BETTER: Your Workout Companion

Welcome to BE BETTER  
A simple yet effective workout companion designed for those who prefer training without specialized equipment. All you need is a resistance band and a pull-up bar to get started!

## About the App

BE BETTER is a straightforward application where I honed my Kotlin programming skills. The app features a classic XML design and utilizes key Android components and techniques:

- RecyclerView & RecyclerView Adapter: For efficient list and grid layouts.
- ViewModel: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- SharedPreferences: For saving user settings and preferences.
- GIF Animations: To enhance user experience with dynamic visuals.
- CountDownTimer: For implementing workout timers.

The app is built with a focus on simple logic and navigation, making it easy to use for anyone.
